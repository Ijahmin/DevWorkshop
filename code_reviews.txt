Good review: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287774/identifying-unnecessary-attributes-in-a-python-class\
This review is good because it describes what changes should be made and an overview of why.

This review has some decent tips, but is not respectful and only provides code examples for comment changes (which is not useful).
